# Simply Kaspa Indexer
A high performance Kaspa PostgreSQL indexer implemented in Rust.  

## About
The indexer has been implemented from scratch by deriving the functional spec of [kaspa-db-filler](https://github.com/lAmeR1/kaspa-db-filler).  
As part of this process the database schema was reworked to better support concurrency.  
This means that databases populated by the lAmeR1/kaspa-db-filler must be migrated to be compatible.  
A schema migration script has been developed and is available [here](https://github.com/supertypo/kaspa-db-filler-migration).  
A compatible version of the kaspa-rest-server is available [here](https://github.com/kaspa-ng/kaspa-rest-server).

## Important notes

### Optional tables
To maximize the performance for your specific needs you should take care to disable any table you don't need through command line flags.  
See --help for a list of optional fields.

### Optional fields
In addition to optional tables, many fields can be left empty if they are not required for your use case.  
Use exclude-fields arguments to fine tune. See --help for a list of optional fields.

### Index by script instead of address
If addresses_transactions_table is NOT disabled and exclude-fields contains tx_out_script_public_key_address (and not tx_out_script_public_key),  
the indexer will use scripts_transactions instead of addresses_transactions for indexing addresses for > 25% space savings.

### Postgres tuning
Make sure to tune Postgres to your specific hardware, here is an example for a server with 12GB RAM and SSD storage:
```
shared_buffers = 2GB
work_mem = 128MB
effective_io_concurrency = 32
checkpoint_timeout = 5min
max_wal_size = 4GB
min_wal_size = 80MB
effective_cache_size = 8GB
```
In addition, I highly recommend running Postgres on ZFS with compression=lz4 (or zstd) for space savings as well as for improving performance. Make sure to also set recordsize=16k.

### Tn11 (10bps) note
The indexer is able to keep up with the 10bps testnet (TN11) under full load (2000+tps) as long as Postgres is running on a sufficiently high-end NVMe.  
By disabling optional tables and fields you can bring the requirements down if running on lesser hardware.

### Historical data
The indexer will begin collecting data from the point in time when it's started.  
If you have an archival node, you can specify the start-block using the --ignore_checkpoint argument and specify an older start block.  
Please make contact with us on the [Kaspa Discord](https://kaspa.org) if you need a pg_dump-file of historical records.

## API
There is a simple api available at http://localhost:8500/api (by default), it currently provides the following endpoints:
- health
- metrics

## Configuration examples

### Minimal configuration
The default is well suited for a block explorers and the like, which is overkill for most other use cases.   
This is the recommended starting point for exchanges and other 'light' integrators:
```
disable:
    block_parent_table,
    blocks_transactions_table,
    addresses_transactions_table

exclude-fields:
    block_accepted_id_merkle_root,
    block_merge_set_blues_hashes,
    block_merge_set_reds_hashes,
    block_selected_parent_hash,
    block_bits,
    block_blue_work,
    block_daa_score,
    block_hash_merkle_root,
    block_nonce,
    block_pruning_point,
    block_utxo_commitment,
    block_version,
    tx_hash,
    tx_mass,
    tx_payload,
    tx_in_signature_script,
    tx_in_sig_op_count,
    tx_in_block_time,
    tx_out_script_public_key_address,
    tx_out_block_time
```

### Enable transactions_inputs_resolve
Having the indexer resolve inputs at index time allows avoiding the expensive join at query time. In essence this load is moved to the indexer, 
except if you also choose to use it to resolve addresses by dropping the addresses_transactions table and querying inputs and outputs directly,
in this case the added effort is zero or even negative. To enable add the argument: --enable=transactions_inputs_resolve.  
  
If you want to have the indexer pre-resolve inputs but already have existing data in the db, you have to manually pre-resolve existing inputs first. 
Make sure the indexer is stopped and apply the following SQL:
```sql
CREATE TABLE transactions_inputs_resolved AS
SELECT
    i.transaction_id,
    i.index,
    i.previous_outpoint_hash,
    i.previous_outpoint_index,
    i.signature_script,
    i.sig_op_count,
    i.block_time,
    o.script_public_key AS previous_outpoint_script,
    o.amount AS previous_outpoint_amount
FROM transactions_inputs i
LEFT JOIN transactions_outputs o
    ON i.previous_outpoint_hash = o.transaction_id
    AND i.previous_outpoint_index = o.index;

DROP TABLE transactions_inputs;
ALTER TABLE transactions_inputs_resolved RENAME TO transactions_inputs;
ALTER TABLE transactions_inputs ADD PRIMARY KEY (transaction_id, index);
ANALYZE transactions_inputs;
```
If you are using kaspa-rest-server you can apply the PREV_OUT_RESOLVED=true env var afterward to disable the expensive join for resolve_previous_outpoints=light queries.

### Address to transaction mapping without separate table
When --enable=transactions_inputs_resolve is specified (see above), you can look up transactions without a separate mapping table.  
  
First make sure the filler is running without exclude on tx_in_block_time and tx_out_block_time.  
If the db already contains inputs and/or outputs without block_time you will have to populate the column manually:
```sql
CREATE TABLE transactions_inputs_with_block_time AS
SELECT
    i.transaction_id,
    i.index,
    i.previous_outpoint_hash,
    i.previous_outpoint_index,
    i.signature_script,
    i.sig_op_count,
    t.block_time,
    i.previous_outpoint_script,
    i.previous_outpoint_amount
FROM transactions_inputs i
JOIN transactions t ON i.transaction_id = t.transaction_id;

DROP TABLE transactions_inputs;
ALTER TABLE transactions_inputs_with_block_time RENAME TO transactions_inputs;
ALTER TABLE transactions_inputs ADD PRIMARY KEY (transaction_id, index);
ANALYZE transactions_inputs;
```
Then use the same method to enrich transactions_outputs with block_time from transactions.  

Lastly the appropriate indexes for efficient querying must be created:
```sql
CREATE INDEX ON transactions_inputs (previous_outpoint_script, block_time DESC);
CREATE INDEX ON transactions_outputs (script_public_key, block_time DESC);
```
Afterward truncate the addresses_transactions/scripts_transactions table, apply --disable=addresses_transactions_table to the indexer and start it.
